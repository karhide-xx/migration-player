    "about_the_reimagined_sound": "I wanted to capture that sense of secrecy and tension that seems to exist within the narrative of the story.  This idea that you cannot record in these areas and also the idea of stress associated with travel and border control etc. This idea that it's illegal to cross a border without going through this process but also illegal to record the process you go through to remain legal.  The whole feeling I got was one of complete tension, frustration and claustrophobia but also the sense of getting home or beyond this.  So I wanted to try and capture how I imagined it would feel to be bossed around while trying to remain calm and get home or to work.  The piece is punctuated with moments of calmer piano but surrounded by a non-stop interference and static created through manipulating the piano and othter source material - including the field recording.  The idea was to generate a sense of how it feels to be in this kind of tiring and stressful environment with little or no control and perhaps a disengagement from reality that is often created in these environments.  I started with just the field recording and piano but slowly added to this and developed this sense of suffocation/claustrophobia.  As the piece comes towards a conclusion I removed many of the fx and brought it back down to just the piano.  I was attempting to imagine the journey and the feeling of an ending and quiet release, at least for a time until the next journey. ",

My desire to do this, came from  coming to understand the power of religion in spaces of migration, liminality and precarity, and the way religion can be used as a source of hope and strength. \n\nThe people I met while working in Bosnia, would always say phrases like \u201cal hamdillah\u201d, god bless, after describing happy moments in life, but also after describing tragic encounters of border violence while trying to cross the borders. I was always shocked that even in telling stories of the violence they experienced they would follow it by using this phrase. \n\nBut through the many conversations I had with people, I have come to understand that through moving in the borders they are confronting by the fullest and truest extent of state sanctioned violence. They are confronted by the magnitude of the state, but what is bigger than these governments which are inflicting injustice on them? God. \n\nThere is something incredibly powerful in knowing that there is something higher than that which is oppressive.

The combination of all these elements create an uneasy and unhomely feeling, the notes drifting around and never reaching any root or place of comfort as his voice is woven through the synth tones until the track ends in a strong minor chord, and all the elements fade to silence, leaving the words \u201cI\u2019m Just Me\u201d echoing and fading. I feel that the phrase encapsulated the entire meaning of the track and was poignant and relevant for the feeling that I was trying to achieve. \n\nI decided to leave a lot of his voice untouched, as I didn\u2019t want to take anything away from the words he was saying; however I did modulate some samples of his voice to fill in the space and contrast the clarity of the main voice samples. The reason that I did this was to try and recreate the feeling of some of the things he was saying, i.e. him not understanding what people were saying to him in a different language.

I grew up and lived all of my life in Chile, until I came to study in the US in 2017. The scene that is described in the field recording has become very familiar in the academic institutions that I\u2019ve attended, where most of the labor behind the repair and construction of new buildings is carried out by Central and South American migrant workers. \n\nThe field recording truly captures the dryness of the weather and reflects on the precarity and exploitation of migrant workers to build luxury condos in a city that is going through a record breaking drought. I originally wanted to emphasize these characteristics in my composition. I started by selecting and classifying different sections of the recording: wind sounds, trucks beeping, voices singing, and nail/staple guns. In this process, it is sometimes impossible to separate the different sound sources as they overlap and are all contained in a stereo recording. I experimented with the FluCoMa library in Max/MSP in order to separate the stereo file in different components. What it does is that it analyzes the sound file and tries to identify and put together sounds that are similar to each other (in their spectral and loudness features). \n\nThrough experimenting with it multiple times, I was able to separate the different sound sources. In many cases it was not perfect, but the imperfections either added a grainy element to the sound, or ended up taking a particular color that was different from the original. I thought these new renderings of the field recording would contribute to the portrayal of precarity and dryness. I constructed the piece using small chunks and snippets from the FluCoMa renderings of the field recordings. \n\nThese were many times stretched and pitch shifted to add variation to the material and play with the pitched elements in the recordings. In the late part of the process I added a variety of synthesized sounds that were processed together with the field recordings through granular synthesis, filters and delays. \n\nIn the end what started to emerge in the piece, was that within the dryness, the precariousness and exploitation, the workers sing, and that singing, I interpret it as an act of resilience, as a desire to keep going in the hope that things will get better. I worked the piece as an immersive multi-channel composition \u2013 this version is a binaural render of it, so it is better experienced with headphones.",

    "about_the_reimagined_sound": "What makes a person consider leaving their home and migrating to another country? In America, considered a land of immigrants, people came for a fresh start, a better life for themselves and their family. There have been many waves of migration to the United States in our history including for example from China in the mid 1800\u2019s, many settling in New York City, the Irish beginning in 1845, the Italians predominantly from 1900 - 1914 and so many more.\n\nNew York City had been the entry point and the destination of many who have made the journey, however today, the migration at the southern border has created a division within the country in how we see new immigration. The debate has raised many questions, one of which has had me questioning why people today, in this moment, would look to America as a destination? Especially in this moment when I have contemplated leaving my home based on the outcome of the the presidential election coming this November.\n\nIn thinking about these questions and in looking at the populations who have arrived here in New York City throughout our history, I can only imagine what must go into a decision of this magnitude. This work I am presenting makes an attempt at addressing these questions. It begins as though in a dream, imagine a voyage across a vast ocean and upon arrival, the surreal feelings of finally arriving and navigating through this new land ultimately finding a community of like people and the beginning of a new reality, a new life and a sense of place in this case all on the corner of Mott and Hester Streets in Chinatown, New York City.\n\nThe music for my composition, A Sense of Place, was composed using Logic Pro. The field recording was altered and decontextualized at the opening and in the dreamlike sequence that follows using Audacity until returning the to the original field recording at the conclusion of the piece.",

In the 19th century, the region - ancestral lands of the Southern Plains Wichita and Affiliated Tribes - was under the flags of Spain and then an independent Mexico before being claimed by the Republic of Texas. \n\nUpon entering the United States in 1845, Texas ceded the area north of 36\u00b030\u2032 latitude to remain a slave state. From 1850-90, the area was called the Public Land Strip, popularly known as No Man's Land. In 1890, the strip of land was opened for settlement for migrants from across the nation and world and incorporated into Oklahoma Territory. In 1907, the area joined the Union as part of the state of Oklahoma, which also included the former Indian Territory, where tribes were forcibly located on the Trail of Tears.\n\nThe sounds recorded are much like those heard over the centuries by Plains Indians, European explorers, and the settler farmers and ranchers, many of whom abandoned their spreads during the epic droughts and wind storms of the Great Dust Bowl of the 1930s.

One of the most common activities for Filipinos (usually men) to engage in is basketball. Every public basketball court in the city is filled with large groups of basketball enthusiasts every evening without fail. Having grown up in this city, I always enjoyed watching them play. Their games are full of laughter and energy. It is also interesting because the game was brought to the Philippines by American settlers in the early 1900s and has become an equally important part of Filipino culture - something that they now take with them wherever they go.\n\nI always get emotionally invested in the games while watching, often clapping and cheering when there is a good moment. The players can get competitive but they always remember to have fun and laugh and not take things very seriously - perhaps a reflection of the Filipino people in general who are always smiling, friendly and easy going.\n",

The feeling of being torn in between two geographical places is something that is in constant flux, and is heavily dependant on a lot of things. Being comfortable in a new environment can quickly be replaced to longing for familiarity, without any particular explanation. \n\nThe context to this recording provided by Zubin, and the clear excitement and joy that can be heard by the players involved in this game of basketball, made me think of the many beautiful moments that I've experienced myself when finding comfort and stability in new places. Therefore, the act of bouncing came to represent the pendulum between birth place, and a new home. I tried to capture the moments of excitement, the sun, and the joy of collective play in my piece that I based around the recording. \n\nI based my composition entirely on the audio file of the field recording, but processed it in various way to create tonality - using resonators and heavy EQing to create clusters of tones mashed together with the texture of the soundscape of the game.

The field recording by Colin Hunter is a living example of the indestructibility of the spirit of the forest that the Batwa pygmies carried with them when they were evicted from the forest land in 1992. Being an immigrant myself and a person who has moved a lot, I can imagine the heartbreak and difficulties migration can bring.\n\nThe field recording I chose for my composition is a welcome song that a group performed for Colin, close to Bwindi National Park. I had two approaches to compose music with it: one was to remix the recording and create something catchy, or to create an ambient track with a strong imaginary sonic landscape around the field recording by editing it and creating many smaller samples out of it.\n\nI settled on the ambient approach because I felt the recording was truly special, and it must teleport a listener to Bwindi and to the difficult migration story. I also felt the ambient approach would help me highlight a sound or melody from different angles without being too shackled to a structural idea.\n\nI imagined the sonic landscape in my composition as if an observer/listener is walking through Bwindi Impenetrable Forest before the migratory chapter and there\u2019s an ongoing celebration. They see different groups singing and dancing, welcoming them while they are surrounded by the greenery of a lush forest and the sheer force of nature unfolding in it.\n\nPerhaps the Batwa pygmies have learned to adapt to new surroundings and new ways of life today, but I think the forest will always remain in their being. To me, Colin\u2019s recording beautifully captures how the performing group\u2019s song is quintessentially connected with the forest.

    "about_the_reimagined_sound": "This composition is informed by the specific ontology of sound as being itinerant, displaced, dislodged and fleeting. Sound is always ripped from its source to travel away from one body to another, and from one place to the other. It vibrates and makes others to vibrate with it. It moves and in doing so absorbs the conditions of its environment, brushes against surfaces, bodies and other sounds. It remains tied to its original context yet creates a space of relation that leads to new connections. Sound in this context is therefore a spatio-temporal event charged with history, culture and relations. \n\nThe source recording itself is uprooted and displaced. It is ripped from its origins; first as the sound of displaced bodies articulating a certain rupture from home, and second as a material ripped from its physical origin by the very act of recording and reshaped by the subjectivity of the microphone and the ears that were pointing it. The subject of the recording itself is also a complex musical weave that entails histories of colonialization, indigenous cultures, and multiple lands. To add to this complexity, Spain being the location of this recording is a return to a distant origine. As one end of the Son Jarocho thread, as the echo of a distant past, \u201ca faded facsimile of the original sound\u201d. Thus, the central theme of migration, its ecology, bidirectionality, intrinsic homelessness and double consciousness are all at the very fabric of this source recording. \n\nWith these notions in mind, I began by positioning myself with respect the source recording. I examined my personal relation to Mexico as the cultural source and the broader context of this recording. Being a diaspora myself, ripped from home and displaced, I had a very subjective and a rather complex relation with this recording. It resonated with my continuous longing to reconnect with my own homeland but also renewed my deep appreciation for the culture and the people of Mexico that I am also away from. So, for me being distant from a land beyond reach and a desire to reconnect with it is a theme that this recording embodies at many levels.\n\nImagining the ritual captured in this recording as a call for home, OutReached is an answer to this call. It stretches this call beyond its acoustic limits across the ocean all the way back \u201chome\u201d. A home that is reimagined through my non-Mexican ears. Through my felt knowledge and sensorial memories and field recordings of Mexico as well as through my own lived history of migration. Except for the source recoding itself, all other sounds and field recordings used in this composition were recorded in different parts of Mexico. Even the impulse response of a rather large exhibition chamber in Mexico was used for the convolution reverb! \n\nTrusting that these sounds were fundamentally bound by their cultural context and common origins, my process of composition was anchored in an agentive and organizational listening to reveal these sounds' common stories. This enabled the sounds to speak for themselves and for the relations they embody to emerge as the musical experience; some due to my intervention as a composer and some beyond my comprehension of the materials and their intrinsic relations. I listened for serendipitous moments of coming together, be it harmonic, rhythmic, textural, spatial, etc. and reimagined a home for the fragments of the source recording to meander across. These far away fragments consist of the unprocessed source recording, its granular swishes as well as the voice in the source recording and the rest of the recording separated from each other via AI tools to add yet another level of rupture while allowing for more compositional freedom.

I was so tired to move away from my couch, my head was aching, and my fingers were moving across the fret board while this tune had emerged.

For instance, the sounds of a busy street or the calls of bird species native to your area can evoke a sense of familiarity. New environments can often be overwhelming, leading us to seek comfort in familiar elements such as language or food to create a sense of home. \n\nI approached this theme by contrasting the intense, unfamiliar sounds of new surroundings with the calming sounds that remind us of home. Many current migrations are driven by oppression, persecution, and violence, contributing to an increasingly dystopian world. I also examine the journey from a state of ease to one of chaos, highlighting the pervasive sense of hopelessness and apathy that often surrounds us.",

I walked around the roundabout of Pio del Pilar barangay hall, which is close to where I currently live. Barangay is the smallest local government unit in the Philippines and came from the pre-colonial word balangay which were traditional boats in the Philippines. When I was growing up in a small town, a former fishing village outside Metro Manila, Good Friday means that we are not allowed to take showers despite the tropical heat and humidity. Establishments are closed. Children should not be unruly, and generally, everyone should stay at home because there is no God watching over. Crucified, he is suffering in pain on this day.\n\nThe sound recorded here is supposed to be a quieter 8:30 evening than usual. The laundromat, the karinderya, and the sari-sari store are all closed. You will hear dogs barking, supposedly domesticated. There is a sound that appears like birds chirping, but I am unsure about this because they could be shrieks of a mouse or something else. There are several voices: a man saying \u201cperfect\u201d, two kids trying to ride a bicycle, a random passerby. You can also hear the rumble of the motorbikes, the quieter hissing of some cars, the build-up of a roar from a mid-sized fire truck, a honk from a teen-age boy driving, and possibly my footsteps and television noises from a random house.\n\nI returned to the Philippines late last year after over three years of living outside the country. I lived for two years in one of the richest countries in the word, and for one year in one of the poorest, classified by the UN as a least developed country (LDC). In three years, I moved in and out of nine apartments for various reasons, lived in four cities for at least a month: Geneva, Zurich, Vientiane, and Bangkok, I got stuck in a city because of Covid-19 policies, went home in January 2022 only to leave again in less than a month without fully unpacking my belonging and my reflections. Living close to this roundabout was not well thought of and I want to leave. Yet, I am unable to move, stuck here in this random destination with no family or friends nearby, and with no specific purpose. Sometimes I fail to remember what I did where and why. I think I am moving too quickly, unprepared for what I am trying to do. Am I really getting good at anything other packing and unpacking, throwing or selling secondhand items, trying to fit all my belongings in one big luggage? I used to think that airports are transitory spaces, but not anymore. Not when I remember how I got stuck in Istanbul airport trying to entertain myself with baklava and not when you count the hours I spent stuck in NAIA. Virginia Woolf said I am rooted but I flow \u2013 and this might be out of context, but I want to borrow it because what I felt and what I still feel is a constant floating and flowing, a state of trying to remain and at the same time move elsewhere.\n",

I took an approach that incorporates various languages and dialects encountered during migration into the composition. As people become accustomed to their new environment, the initially unintelligible languages and cultures become understandable. \n\nThis process is reflected in how city noises and conversations gradually transform into discernible linguistic elements. I use the AI plugin 'Morpho' from Neutone.ai to transform these recordings into musical elements. In the first section, I emphasize music while reducing linguistic elements to represent the initial stage of cultural adaptation. As the piece progresses, I gradually increase the linguistic elements to reflect the growing familiarity and understanding of the new culture.",

The music has repetitive, soothing and entrancing qualities. \n\nThe hosts of the hostel are playing and the guests are listening, but the lines begin to blur as guests join in.

Inspired by Mad Professor's philosophy that \"every song could be dubbed,\" I set out to create the dub version of this recording. Drawing from the roots of dub music and its ability to fragment and reassemble soundscapes, I aimed to capture the essence of migration through sonic exploration.\n\nThrough my dub interpretation, I sought to invite listeners on a transcendent journey, where the boundaries between cultures dissolve and the shared human experience of migration comes to the forefront. Just as dub music has migrated from Jamaica to influence global musical landscapes, my dub version of the Marrakech hostel recording resonates with the universal themes of movement, adaptation, and transformation.",

Whether driven by safety or change, we connect with new worlds, bringing pieces of home to unfamiliar places and returning with new experiences. We build on what we know and explore what we encounter, exchanging views on life, customs, trends, language, and recipes. Even on the shortest journey, we create bonds that transcend distance.\n\nIn many cultures, travelers are welcomed with greetings, food, and drink. This hospitality, deeply rooted in my Moldovan upbringing, thrives in places like farmer and flea markets. These markets are social hubs where people exchange news and form connections. In Soroca, farmers from neighboring villages and Ukraine gather at the market (Pia\u0163a/Bazar) to sell their goods, creating a sensory experience rich with diverse languages, aromas, and interactions.\n\nAt these markets, you hear the latest news, tales of love and conflict, wedding invitations, funerals, or even get a psychic reading. They are cultural melting pots, where stories from strangers transport you to ordinary and extraordinary places. These moments linger in memory, resurfacing in similar interactions later in life. I felt this in Istanbul, where food markets reminded me of the connections between social life and migration.\n\nReturning to Moldova after years in the USA was profound. As an immigrant re-experiencing my hometown, being in Moldova's Roma capital felt symbolic and meaningful. My favorite spot in Soroca is the halfway point towards Dealul \u0162iganilor (Roma Hill), offering an unforgettable view of Moldova and Ukraine. It's a place where you feel connected to both sides of the river, appreciating the geography's uniqueness.\n\nOur experiences build a cultural database, helping us compare and understand what we know with what we encounter. We find similarities, appreciate uniqueness, learn, and share with others. A story unfolds through words, sounds, and pictures, enhanced by shared food, language, and beliefs.\n\nWe seek home, shuffling memories of comfort, belonging, and safety. We long for something fresh and exciting, yet secure enough to build a future. All these lives, encounters, and paths have a soundtrack, as migrant as we are.\n\nInspired by my experiences, I wanted to create a track based on memories of the farmers market (Pia\u0163a) in Soroca city center, where sensory overload is guaranteed. The track had to reflect the multiculturality of Soroca, featuring all the modern and historical influences blended into a cohesive sound hybrid that also represents me as an artist. The cacophony of sounds\u2014blips of conversation, snippets of radio, and passing cars\u2014creates a massive symphony. \nAs a child, I would weave these random sounds into patterns, rhythms, or songs, realizing that everything is melody, and everything is sound.\n",

We retained the last question as it pointed to creating a context of a sense of hope for others in Astoun\u2019s words and actions.\n\nOur approach to the music was simple. We listened and sat in Astoun\u2019s story, went to our music room, set-up on the floor, and recorded live to the room in one take. There was no rehearsal - this was an \"in-the-moment\" response. We used a combination of analogue beats, keys, and looped synth. What came out seemed almost to been drawn more from what Astoun was talking about in such a calm, considered way. Our response acknowledges Astoun speaks as a witness and mobiliser from the frontline of humanitarian crisis, bringing visibility to the stories of displaced lives in distress at sea, and who would never be heard. \n\nAstoun\u2019s resilience is stark and compelling.  It urges reflection on what is really happening in the world, and a reminder of the inherent rights of all peoples to safety and dignity.

All sounds, despite whole noisiness of the space, were somehow reflected almost like a regular delay line. I took this phenomenon as a main subject in composition.\n\nDuring the work on the material, I\u2019d been trying to \"zoom in\" on the sound and try to express this idea of the reflection as much as possible. \"Zooming in\" gave me a lot of different material, that can\u2019t be found during regular listening.\n\nI think this idea of the reflection corresponds in very strange way to the story that covers under the recording. These poor three women, which were forced to abandon their personal stuff, they didn\u2019t receive any \"emotional reflection\" from the workers of the airport, but the space was responding to them.",

    "about_the_recording": "What does urban sprawl sound like in a traffic-choked city? This recording is of a street intersection in a residential part of Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan.  The whistle is from a policeman who has been instructed to stand amidst the traffic so as to over-ride the traffic lights, because the traffic lights can't deal with the volume of urban traffic. \n\nBishkek is typical of many cities, in experiencing both a dramatic increase in population (from 600,000 at the end of the Soviet Union to an estimated 1.5 million today) and a huge increase in the number of private cars, the result of rural to urban migration and the growth of peri-urban migrant districts.  \n\nThe result is that 'probki' (traffic jams) are a constant of city life and 'traffic chaos' a constant topic of conversations. Attempts to encourage the public to switch to public transport have been hindered by botched reforms, an insufficient number of buses, and the wide distances that people have to cover to get to the city proper.

Secondly, the people moving between the parts of the city. Thirdly, an internal migration - drifting away from the traffic jam to a dreamlike space where the environmental sounds are muffled and become a flow of thoughts and memories.\n\nWhile working on this piece, I migrated from the digital medium to the analogue and back. I recorded separate frequency bands of the original audio on a 4-track tape, added subtle effects and kept bouncing the tracks (combining two or three tracks on one) until the original material became indiscernible as if creating a parallel lane of traffic leading elsewhere, away from the busy street. \n\nThen I recorded electric bass layers as a counterpoint to the whistle blows of the traffic managing policeman. But a melody never develops; the guitar imitates the monotony of the shrill tones and plays with their irregularity. And so the policeman\u2019s whistle morphs into a musical instrument, the traffic becomes a wave. A kid\u2019s voice brings you back to the reality. Does it though? Are there any tigers around?

It's been a regular, dependable, unchanging part of my life until I left home, and even after I left home, first moving cities, and then countries, and only came back to visit.\n\nThe \"campana della sera\" (evening bell) used to ring every night at 21:00 for exactly five minutes. I believe it used to signal the end of the day for a community mostly based on farming. My family have many memories linked to the bells. My paternal grandfather used to be the town's bell ringer for many years, before the whole process was automated with the arrival of a timer clock and a small engine. He would cycle up to the church and ring the bells at given times and - this was many decades ago, before my time - even before a particularly menacing storm. I remember that he allowed me into the bell tower a couple of times: I stood there fascinated by the noise and by the huge ropes he was pulling.\n\nSadly, the bell as it is heard in this recording is no longer heard. A few years ago, after requests from residents, the monotone chime was replaced by a shorter melody, apparently more suited to modern ears.

The voices capture a moment of transition, as these individuals navigate the complexities of immigration procedures and adapt to a new environment.\n\nEmotions in the recording might range from apprehension and uncertainty among the migrants to empathy and concern from those witnessing their arrival.

Percussive sounds were used for drum patterns and the train whistle forms the patch for the mysterious melody.\n\nThe original recording has a U shape in terms of its energy. The train is arriving, it stops and then it moves again. My track follows this same pattern and situates the listener in the same perspective as the recordist.  You can hear most of the original recording throughout the track. We arrive in the story whilst it is in full swing, on the road to somewhere, the anticipation of starting something, a new life perhaps. We arrive and are greeted with confusion, there is movement in all directions, yet we are staying still. We hear sounds of people on the platform, people get off, people get on. Tensions are high, but we calmly observe the scene unfold around us. The energy gradually builds up and the train departs the station, continuing once again on its journey. Who is still with us? Who has joined? What have we left behind? Where are we going anyway?\n\nI wanted to create something that gave the sense of being on a journey, capturing a sense of anticipation and excitement, combined with urgency and uncertainty.

    "about_the_reimagined_sound": "I.        Breathing Steps\nII.        Lightwell\nIII.        To fight? No, to sing!\n\n In the field recording I chose, a street musician plays and hums the tune of the Kozachok on the accordion, while people are heard passing by in Jerusalem\u2019s Armenian Quarter. I was immediately captivated by the sound of the accordion, but also by the unforced openness with which the musician hummed the tune. Reading about the recording, I learnt about the history of the Quarter, its antiquity and the monks who first migrated there. This brought me back to a theme that has been a constant in my life and artistic practice: travel and migration as an act of faith.\n\n Leaving one\u2019s country is an enormous leap of faith; it is both proof and a test of the strength of that faith, its trust in a kind of Divine Grace. You must believe that you will be looked after both along the way and when you arrive at your destination; you must believe that the residents of other lands, the ones you pass through and the one in which you might settle will be friendly and welcoming, and not hostile, distant or indifferent. You travel and migrate trusting that in Others, you will meet the face of what in Sufism is called the Beloved; and, approaching travel in this way, you are the vulnerable Foreigner, the Stranger, the Wanderer.  \n\n This is true if you are a merchant, a monk or \u2018holy person\u2019, a family or a roving musician; but it is especially true if you are a woman. In researching for the piece, I stumbled across a poem by contemporary Armenian poet Hasnik Simonian, who speaks of an autumn \u2018stretched and squeezed like an accordion\u2019 while she wanders, \u2018praying with my hands in my pockets\u2019, as \u2018poet-girls\u2019 do, \u2018step by step\u2019. I thought about the privilege of walking and travelling alone, and just how much of an act of faithful defiance to restrictive social norms it can be for some of us. A part of the poem is included in the piece, read by Eleni Sisti. \n  \nFor years, I have returned again and again to the figure of a Persian-speaking Armenian-Jewish merchant, poet and mystic called Sarmad Kashani, who travelled to Mughal India in the 17th century. In his Rubaiyat (parts of which are heard read by Navid Fayaz) he expresses with undaunted sincerity the nature and struggle of a form of faith that wishes to remain open, trusting, non-sectarian, undogmatic, and accepting of its own uncertainty and fallibility. In the poem which gives the title to this piece [here in English translation by Syeda Saiyidain Hameed], he writes: \n\nIf the heart has Wisdom, its embrace will hold the Friend\nIf the eye can see, the Radiance is Everywhere\nIf the ear can listen, what else but praise of God? \nIf the tongue can speak, every word reveals the Mystery\n\nDespite the evident depth of his faith, Sarmad was executed by Emperor Aurangzeb, allegedly for atheism and unorthodox religious practices. One of the reasons why he has captured my imagination for years is exactly his fate as an apostate, a daring objector to the dogma of power and religious hypocrisy. In choosing a recording of the Kozachok from Jerusalem at this time of senseless bloodshed in Israel and Palestine, Ukraine, Sudan and other parts of the world, I felt that both Sarmad\u2019s objection to tribalism and his understanding of the Other as the face of God are a fitting counterpoint to the kind of religious and ethnic hatred that pits people against each other and which is used by ruthless, cynical leaders to kill, control and indoctrinate.  \n  \nTravel and migration, at their core, hold the belief that the earth is to be shared and experienced by all of us \u2013 and not just all of us humans but also other forms of life. The Armenian folk song \u2018Mer tan itev\u2019, from the historically Armenian region of Shadakh in modern day Turkey, is a hymn to the sharing of the fruits of the land and to marriage. It is heard here sung by the acapella quartet Asma Cordis. In another Armenian folk poem, read by me, the speaker mourns the loss of their beloved, who has left to join a war. Perhaps it was a war that was seen as justified, against a neighbour turned enemy, against a heathen, an infidel, an adversary; but if we are all each other\u2019s Strangers, why must we continue to fight, when we can sing in praise instead? \n \nThe composition is structured around fleeting field recordings (sometimes manipulated) from my own walking travels, mostly of street musicians, or musicians practicing and heard from the street, but also of various ambient sounds, including recordings from London, Athens, Cagliari and Reykjavik. Poets, musicians and birds migrate from far and distant places; they too wander and bring the sounds of other lands and languages with them, mixing and blending along the way. Overall, my aim has been to pay homage to this: the travelling Radiance everywhere; the road that welcomes everyone and everything unconditionally. \n\nContributors \nChris Sakellaridis: Composition, Field Recordings, Voice (English) \nEleni Sisti: Voice, (Armenian) \nNavid Fayaz: Voice, (Farsi) \nAcapella group Asma Cordis (Georgia Palioura, Anna Maria Markantoni, Irini Athanasoula, Marianna Athanasoula): Folk Song \u2018Mer Dan Itev\u2019 \nVarious Street Musicians \nBirds, Sea, Bells, Wind \n\n",

While the two men share the sunrise in Amad, Rob notices the stark difference of perspectives between them. One emigrated easily to Indonesia, while the other does not have the resources to make this choice of moving abroad.\nThe field recording oozes a peaceful atmosphere : the rooster signals the start of day, and in the background we can hear birds, a motorcycle, a broom sweeping. I chose to focus on two aspects: friction, and the sea.\n\nFriction, present both in sound and sound processing, illustrates the proximity and disparity of the two men. I see it as an evocation of the friction between a migrant and his land of adoption, of between natives and migrants. The encounter causes a transformation, and sometimes an erosion. Most samples are generated through a friction process, may it be in the physical world (bowed piano, bowed glass), or through sound synthesis. Indeed, I have generated a wide array of sounds using a Low Frequency Oscillators (LFO). The resulting sound are caused by an interaction between two sound waves (one of them being out of the audible spectrum).\n\nThe ocean had to be part of this musical evocation somehow. The two men are diving instructors and therefore spend a fraction of their existence at sea rather than on the land. The ocean is also a passageway for migration. Both men are equal in the ocean. They are guests in this realm, and can stay for a short duration only. I chose to suggest the depths of the ocean, its calmness, but also its eerie, powerful and menacing qualities, with basses, low pass filters, samples (including glass sounds that allude to sand).

The neighbours told me they would be back for the dry season. \n\nIn this recording, you can listen to a conversation between the head of the household, my interpreter, and myself. Our discussion takes place in three different languages: Bissau-Guinean Creole, Portuguese, and Fula. In the background children can be heard playing, and two women engage in conversation while operating sewing machines. Each year, the heavy rains force these families to abandon the houses and seek refuge elsewhere, as the head of the household explains, \"We have to constantly remove water from our house, day and night, and it exhausts us.\" \n\nThey normally abandon the house around September and return in December. Yet they refuse to abandon it permanently and instead choose to stay elsewhere in the city: \u201cIf we abandon the house for too long they will take the zinc from the doors and many other things\u201d As they return in the dry season, they must make reparations or buy the stolen materials. \n\nFlooding damages the house structure, and they can only repair it partially due to their financial condition. The house was built by his brother around 2017, and at that time, they did not experience flooding to this extent. But building here was an option because it was affordable. \n\nThis family is originally from the secondary city of Gab\u00fa, which they often go back to to visit family members and sometimes stay for one or two months. However, their responsibility towards towards the house has never made them consider leaving the capital and returning to Gab\u00fa. The emotions expressed by the head of the household and the women nearby are marked by a profound sense of hardship. Despite the burdens they bear, they possess a resolute resistance.\n",

I\u2019d visited several times before as a tourist and had fallen in love with the place so much that I spent a couple of years positioning myself professionally so that someone would give me a job so I could get a work visa.\n\nWhen most people imagine the animals of Greenland, they immediately think of polar bears. But it is not common to see them and many Greenlanders have never seen one. Ravens, on the other hand, are everywhere - including throughout Greenlandic art and stories. They are one of the few birds that remain all winter, are unafraid of humans, and have a seemingly infinite variety of calls. For me, they are the symbol of my adopted home.\n\nThis recording was taken along the \u201cocean road\u201d \u2013 one of the most beautiful walks in Sisimiut.

    "about_the_reimagined_sound": "I gravitated towards this raven recording from Greenland for a few reasons. Personally, I love birds, have two pet parrots, and find ravens quite captivating. As someone who grew up and spent most of his time in the Pacific Northwest, I regularly see and hear ravens. I love hearing the strange repertoire of sounds they produce, and they can even mimic human speech. They're a remarkably intelligent species, but one that is often misunderstood. They're often mistaken for crows, and as scavengers have historically been associated with death or bad luck. They also feature heavily in many mythologies. Indigenous peoples such as the Haida here in the Paciific Northwest esteem the raven as the creator of the world, but also as a trickster god. On another personal note, I recently graduated from UBC's school of social work, and our logo features a raven.\n\nAs I started playing around with the sound, I gravitated towards a faster pounding rhythm. This may have been because I had just finished classes and was ready to release some cathartic tension, but at some point I realized that techno had some interesting paralllels with ravens. Both have managed to successfully thrive all over the world, transplanting from one place to another and adapting to different environments. Furthermore, ravens and techno are subject to misunderstanding. To the outsider, techno may seem intimidating, simple, strange and scary. I also felt that techno was an appropriate genre to capture the contrasting aspects of ravens between their darkness and playfulness.\n\nThe song got off to a rather disjointed start and didn't seem to really gel at first. I loaded the recording into my sampler and drum machine to convert it into loops and one-shots that I could sequence, but I wasn't totally happy with how it was coming together. I decided to try running the recording through a reverb with a long decay, then splitting the signal into high, mid and low frequency bands using a filter. These three bands were then sequenced into separate rhythms. This element tied everything together, but also provided a propulsive rhythm that really drove everything forward. You can hear the original recording at the start of the track, which then feeds into the reverb filter sequenced technique.",

Modern Greenlanders still use sled dogs for hunting and winter transportation, but the traditional ways have been quickly eroded by the introduction of snowmobiles, which are easier to handle, don\u2019t require feeding in summer, and can go further, faster. \n\nGreenland has introduced several programs to ensure that dogsledding remains an important part modern culture and that traditional knowledge is maintained.

From this basis, I crafted a narrative that unfolds from the refugees' being elsewhere and their subsequent transfer to the centre to their feelings of imprisonment and arrest, culminating in the eruption of the riot. \n\nI employed the field recording in fragments and samples, deconstructing it to produce an alternative narrative.

We can hear the dance of the Aztec fire (Familia Ram\u00edrez) merging with Afghan rhythms played on the table (Hamid Raouf Habibzadah), followed by a kind of incantation in Dari, Spanish, and English that turns into a quasi-ritual cacophony where we become burning flames.

It contains the voice of Mohammed, one of the many refugees who were stuck in a makeshift camp in Greece, as they were trying to make their way up north into central Europe. I wasn't aware of this incident back then so I did a little digging and read a few news articles about the situation of the refugees and camps in Eidomeni and was very sad to find out about how men, women and children had to put up with terrible living conditions and endure bad weather conditions. It also made me reflect on the current situation in Palestine and how so many people are displaced and forced to leave their homes just to survive. Not much has changed in the last 8 years.\n\nBut what stood out to me about this particular story, was how determined these people were to reach their destination. Despite the Balkan Corridor being shut, being stuck without proper roofs over their heads and access to food and water, they remained hopeful and refused to go back. Even though Mohammed's voice and story is sad, I wanted to compose a 'hopeful' and visual piece for this project.\n\nI wanted to keep the field recording as is for the most part, but I treated it like spoken word or poetry - where I repeated certain lines/phrases to add emphasis. I also used some subtle vocal effects to distort his voice.\n\nThe arrangement begins with a kind of droning bass playing the same note repeatedly without change - representing being stuck. In the background there are sounds of thunder, which were created using FM synthesis.\n\nI really wanted to record an acoustic piano for this project and reached out my friend Samantha who gladly agreed to help me write and perform a piano arrangement. The piano had a noisy sustain pedal, which we initially found hard to work with but decided to record anyway. Later on we thought about how naturally lo-fi it sounded - being slightly out of tune combined with the squeaky pedal was growing on us. We both agreed that it fit the emotion and story (reminded us of the 2002 movie: The Pianist).\n\nI also wrote and programmed synthesiser parts: an ascending melody to represent the refugees moving up towards Europe and another melody that adds a feeling of slight uncertainty. One was recorded on a Korg Minilogue through a TC Electronics reverb unit and the other was on a modular synth in VCV Rack.\n\nTowards the end of the piece, there are sounds of rain which were also synthesised electronically.

However, disconcertingly, when I used some simple processing on the sound file of the children, it took on a somewhat darker tone and, to me, sounded like a person shouting for help and struggling in the water. By editing and layering this file there are more distressed voices crying for help. At times these are a sonic juxtaposition to the happy enjoyment of the original children playing.

But every time I moved, French people immediately hear I'm not from France. \nIn the present recording from last year I remember very well how very local people, those who might be attached to their own habits, welcomed me. I sat there with my recording gear to record cicada, but when they started playing they asked me where I was from. All in all they invited me to participate, they explained the rules, of course in their local accent! They didn't mind me recording their voices. \n\nThe welcoming kindness still gives me shivers and confidence in people we do not know and who we might judge before knowing them. Immigration can rime with integration and acceptation. ",

    "about_the_reimagined_sound": "Heartmoor is a word coined by John Koenig in his Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows that means the place to which the heart is anchored, whether that place exists now or ever existed. And that is what this piece is about: the longing we feel to belong somewhere. Whether we\u2019ve had that place and lost it or have never found it, we still seek it.\n\nUsing melodies that travel through layers of sound worlds, this piece calls to mind various homes we\u2019ve had, wish we\u2019ve had, or might still have, and evokes a sense of longing. \n\nI was drawn to this field recording because the sound of cicadas conjures up a nostalgia for the idle summer afternoons of childhood, which got me thinking about home. Then as I read that this field recording captures a moment where an outsider is invited to belong, I appreciated that this sound reflected the idea that when we seek to belong we are also seeking home. That attempt to belong is something I often thought about when I lived outside of my home country for many years, and I wanted to explore it in this piece. ",

    "about_the_recording": "I live on a very ordinary suburban street - the sort of place you really wouldn't take any notice of as you drive past - with pebbledash houses, a storage centre and a supermarket at one end of the road, and a recreation ground at the other. On first look, it might seem rather sleepy - even a bit bland. But it is a place defined by migration. \n\nThe people who live here come from an extraordinary array of places and migration has played a massive role in many of our lives in one way or another and (simply by living here and sharing this space) in all of our lives to some extent. Most of us know each other pretty well, and we have a street Whatsapp Group, so I invited everyone over for drinks earlier this month.  The recording is a brief window into the very ordinary nature of my relationship with my very amazing neighbours. \n\nThe guests who were present at the time of this recording include:\n- My nextdoor neighbour to the left - who is a Chilean refugee, now in her 80s, who was a teacher in her earlier years. She fled the Pinochet regime with her husband (who sadly died earlier this year) in the 1970s: he had been a doctor specialising in respiratory diseases in Chile, but after relocating to the UK became a leading psychiatrist specialising in support for refugees. \n- My neighbour to the right, now in her 90s, was also at the drinks, with her daughter. She and her husband (who also passed away earlier this year) were artists whose lives took them to live in Toronto, New York, India and Cornwall. One huge part of their lives involved driving their three young daughters to India in the 1960s to learn artisanal fabric printing techniques with Indian craftspeople, and the materials and ideas they subsequently imported back to the UK were hugely influential in late 1960s fashions - with Yoko Ono among people who wore their designs. \nOther visitors included:\n- The young father whose family live opposite my house -  they moved to the UK from China and their 8 month old baby is the newest arrival on the street. \n- Another young couple - both economists from Italy - were there too with their baby, who is also under one year old, and their three year old daughter. \n- From further down the street was a neighbour from Mexico, who pointed out that my Guacamole needed extra salt, and who is married to a British husband, and who has two teenage daughters. \n- A Czech/German neighbour brought her daughter who spent hours playing with my dog. \n- From all the way at the far end of the street was a Dutch artist, who occasionally taught my kids at their local secondary school, and who is married to a Flamenco guitarist who is very proud of his Romany heritage. \n- Another guest is half-Austrian and his wife is half-Jamaican - their kids are now grown up, and used to babysit for mine - he has a very infectious (and loud) laugh. \n\nSeveral of our guests had not lived overseas, but are part of this friendly mix of people from all over. I also had a number of people who wanted to make it but could not - one is the son of one of the last children to arrive on the Kindertransport, evacuated from Nazi Germany, and his wife's father was part of the community of Jews expelled from Baghdad in the middle of the last century. Another is also the descendent of German Jews who fled the holocaust. \nA Bulgarian couple with a new baby who have recently moved to the street were invited too, but unable to come, and some of the students from down the road (from France, Spain and the US) were also unable to make it.  \n\nAs for me: I\u2019m a returned migrant \u2013 I lived in the USA for a couple of years, but came back. My Granny on my mum\u2019s side was born and raised in Morocco, and my Father\u2019s family came from the Scottish Islands via Canada (for a couple of generations) to Liverpool and then Lancashire.\n",

In Taiwan, temples also hold significant importance as gathering places, serving as focal points for communal and spiritual activities. As a multicultural island country with a long historical tradition of immigration since the 17th century, Taiwan has witnessed waves of people arriving from various places. Those who crossed the sea to Taiwan brought with them their local beliefs, which took root and flourished in this dynamic and diverse environment.\n\nReflecting on my multiple moving experiences, I no longer have the opportunity to return to my old homes. However, the temples near my old homes still stand. They were the spiritual support for my family while we lived there. I revisited temples where I had worshipped throughout my life, capturing field recordings both inside and outside these sacred spaces. The distances between my homes and the temples became reference coordinates for composition.\n\nDuring the process of collecting sounds, an unexpected coincidence occurred. One of the temples was undergoing renovation, and the sounds of construction intertwined with the monks' evening chants. The repetitive rhythm of human striking the wooden fish resonated with the flowing industrial machine noise, as if everything was in a state of becoming, with the space encompassing all.\n\nI proportionally stretched the field recording from the Migration Sounds archive based on the distance between the UK and Taiwan. Since leaving the UK in 2020 due to the pandemic, memories of living in London have become distant and vague.

London is an especially fantastic city in this regard with many moving to the city from near, far and all over.\n\nMigration can often come with uncertainty and goes hand in hand with the unexpected and challenging. I used these ideas to inform my composition building my piece around the a-rhythmical percussive element of the recording. I employed one of my favourite techniques - phasing - to create the illusion of the piece falling in and out of time. Phasing is when multiple layers are played simultaneously at slightly different speeds which in turn creates a sort of galloping effect known as phasing. If left to run long enough it creates new patterns and rhythms within the moments of chaos and seeming randomness. I felt like this was a create was to depict the ever changing nature of migration. \n\nThe first half of the piece illustrates the process of \"migration\" and I look at the second half of the piece as when our protagonists have \"migrated\" - phasing rhythms play less of a part and the focus becomes more centred around textured chords interacting with the lunar new year recording itself, twisting and wrapping around the metallic noise to find a home within their new territory, their new pride.",

    "about_the_reimagined_sound": "Ever since I was 7 years old and first \"played\" with the Interactive Media of Encarta 97 Encyclopedia World Music on my computer, I became captivated by the sounds of Trinidad's steel drums. These sounds, perhaps through cultural associations, filled me with absolute joy. In the naive imagination of a 7-year-old Peruvian girl, the Caribbean was portrayed as a paradise brimming with life and carnival vibes. As a young girl just starting her percussion workshop at school, I dreamed of playing in a live steel pan band.\n\nAs I delved deeper into the history of this instrument and learned about the colonization stories behind it, my perspective began to shift. On the one hand, working with recordings of steel drum music still evokes fond memories of an ever-happy past shaped by its presence in pop culture. Conversely, as a migrant, I felt compelled to share the stories behind the waves of migration from colonized lands to those of the colonizers. Now, using sample technologies from DAWs I can play along with this live steel drum band. I resonate emotionally and critically with the desire to preserve one's traditional culture, especially coming from a migrant background in the land of the colonizers. Despite facing structural racism and other forms of violence, I admire how the pan players infuse the grey skies with the vibrant colors of calypso and soca, even amidst the distant echoes and noises of Brixton's tube station.\n",

Today, the land they call home is revered as one of the most spiritual places in Egypt.\n\nDespite enduring discrimination, stigma, and stereotyping over the years, many modern Bedouins have adapted to a semi-nomadic or settled lifestyle. During the Israeli occupation between 1967 and 1982, Bedouins insisted on remaining on their land, earning them the label of traitors from the larger Egyptian public.",

The birds, machines & humans may well migrate, but subject to different constraints. I like the fact that the man singing is collecting recycling which may migrate to another location prior to processing (possibly to another country entirely). He is a part of a much larger system, but clearly asserts his humanity - far from a cog in a wheel.\n\nIt seemed inappropriate to impose a rigid tempo grid on such a freeform snatch of song, so the tempo adapts to the recording; it varies as time goes along. I enjoy listening to the machine adjusting to human cadence, hurrying to catch up and struggling to stay in sync. It seems a better that way round than the opposite, and we might be in a better world if more (including the way we think about migration) things worked that way.\n\nOften field recordings (& just listening to the world!), provide enjoyable juxtapositions, fortuitous call & response patterns, whether intended or not, and I hope this piece succeeds in tapping into and replicating some of that energy.\n\nAll synth and drum sounds courtesy of a range of software and analog synths & drum machines.

She was teaching her all about her homeland of France talking about animals she could \u201cbarely imagine\u201d (wolves and sheep) and learning the names of the French rivers, plants and the seasons,.  As part of the course, she recorded her daughter in Cartagena reciting this story that she had learnt as a child.  \n\nThe lovely idea of passing on skills, knowledge and memories from our past to our children is a very beautiful part of them understanding, allowing them in turn pass on their heritage and traditions.\n\nFinding the translation of the poem (see below) and the moral of the fable that \u201cThe tyrant can always find an excuse for his tyranny and that the unjust will not listen to the reasoning of the innocent\u201d, I knew that this powerful story might relate to millions of people in the world being displaced and forced to migrate from their homeland by tyrannical regimes.\n\nI wanted the piece to feel like an old story being told, that leads the listener through an imaginary landscape to a dramatic ending. The child\u2019s voice was so beautiful that I wanted to keep the narration of the vocal as it was - if you listen closely you can hear the birds singing in the background.  I used several reverbs on the voice and inserted music between phrases to extend the track.\n\nThe piece starts with a solo violin and leads the listener through an imaginary landscape.  The harmony is folk like in its simplicity with a simple piano like ostinato, whilst the melodies are deliberately emotional to evoke a sense of vulnerability and dark power.  Cello solos are featured between the storytelling to add to the emotion, supported by slow moving string parts.  Layers of agitated strings with grainy swells add to the drama as the piece builds to the climax when the wolf carries the lamb into the woods \u201cand then eats him without any other why or wherefore\u201d. \n\nHere is a translation of The Wolf and the Lamb by Jean de La Fontaine:\n\nThe reason of those best able to have their way is always the best:\nWe now show how this is true.\u2028A lamb was quenching its thirst\nIn the water of a pure stream.\nA fasting wolf came by, looking for something;\nHe was attracted by hunger to this place.\n\u2014What makes you so bold as to meddle with my drinking?\nSaid this animal, very angry.\nYou will be punished for your boldness.\n\u2014Sir, answered the lamb, let Your Majesty\nNot put himself into a rage;\nBut rather, let him consider\nThat I am taking a drink of water\nIn the stream\nMore than twenty steps below him;\nAnd that, consequently, in no way,\nAm I troubling his supply.\n\u2014You do trouble it, answered the cruel beast.\nAnd I know you said bad things of me last year.\n\u2014How could I do that when I wasn\u2019t born,\nAnswered the lamb; I am still at my mother\u2019s breast.\n\u2014If it wasn\u2019t you, then it was your brother.\n\u2014I haven\u2019t a brother.\u2014It was then someone close to you;\nFor you have no sympathy for me,\nYou, your shepherds and your dogs.\nI have been told of this.

I recorded it and sent cassettes to my friends in Sweden for evidence. Stockholm was, and still is, a comparatively quiet city with few high-rises. \n\nI was also very much taken by the abrupt advertising on the radio (I did not have a TV).

The added shortwave radio static, often fading or corrupted, was processed with digital effects to simulate further degradation, creating a ghostly quality reminiscent of voices lost in the ether.

The players run from one end of the field to the other, chasing the ball and trying to score. We can hear the ball being passed around and some attempts of shooting the ball, resulting in a loud, metallic 'bang' against the metal caging of the field. You can also hear men shouting in different languages like French, Marokan, English and other languages.\n\nThe football court is located in the Northern Quarter of Brussels, in the Park Maximilian. This park is known as a hub for (trans)migrants that have arrived in Brussels and are looking for asylum or a passage to the UK. Often in precarious conditions, they collectively stay in the park, mostly because of its proximity to the Federal Bureau of Immigration Affairs. Aid workers and social organisations have also set up some infrastructure for food and shelter in and around the park. The presence of the immigrants in Park Maximilian has been covered a lot in Belgian Media and has often been portrayed as a symbol of the 'migration crisis' that started since 2015.\n\nThe Maximilian Park is also a place of leisure and recreation for the inhabitants of the large apartment blocks surrounding the park. The residents of these housing units use the park for sporting activities and as a playing ground for their kids. \nThe large presence of immigrants in the park is controversial among the locals and has resulted in some concerns about safety. They blame the Belgian government for not adequately dealing with this issue and finding structural solutions.\n\nIn the recording, the football game is a match between local youths, that hang around in the park, and a group of transmigrants from Eritrea. For me personally, this recording captures a moment where these two groups find each other and use the game of football to vent their frustrations. You can also hear this in the recording, where the game sometimes slightly tilts towards to conflict. It represents the ways in which local urban communities set up informal structures to deal with the perceived issues that come with migration.\n",

I come here with my wife, Heather, and our children when we can save up enough to pay for the airfare, as it is a critical opportunity for my family to connect with their cousins, and particularly for my wife to see her niece and nephew, who she loves very deeply and for whom she tries to play a sort of maternal role - even though we live on the other side of the world. \n\nFaceTime plays a huge role. In 2016 my wife's sister, Clare, died from cancer at the age of 40, she left behind her husband and two small children - who were 6 and 3 at the time. She had moved from the UK to Australia more than 10 years earlier, and the separation from her sister had been really hard on my wife even before the loss. Marc, my brother-in-law, has done an incredible job raising the kids on his own since then - I don't have many heroes, but he is one of them, and the kids are growing up into wonderful young people. \n\nMarc had moved to the UK in the late 1990s with his older brother, Byron, and they had lived together in London, before his brother moved to Dorset, on the south coast of England, where he has lived ever since. Marc and Clare moved to Australia when Marc's mother was very ill. Byron had only been back to Australia for his mother's funeral and for Clare's funeral, and had not seen his sister, Megan, since Clare's funeral in 2016. \n\nFor Christmas this year Marc and his family hosted both of his siblings, me, Heather and the kids, and Megan's kids too (and some friends). He had managed to keep Byron's return to Australia a secret from Megan, and this recording captures the moment Byron came into the kitchen from the utility room as Megan's Xmas present. Megan's response is priceless (even if it was at such a spectacular volume that it created some momentary clipping on the recording). \n\nWhile migration, separation and loss have been cruel to my family and to Marc's, most of the time we just get on with our otherwise very happy lives, and loving one another from across the world. The sheer joy of this moment was a delight, and to have captured it in this recording is wonderful.",

    "about_the_reimagined_sound": "Rob's story brought a slight tear to my eye at first read, and before even hearing the sound, I knew I was going to want to do minimal processing to the sound itself, as what it captures is really quite a beautiful story, although rooted in sadness, and certainly sees the family making some kind of progress after what has been some difficult years with the loss of a loved one and the separation, not to mention COVID being in the middle of all that.\n\nThe first section of the composition sees the sound of the original recording reversed, and drifting in and out, with a slightly deep and constant bass-line. To me this felt like I was capturing perhaps the sadder years, closer to the time of the death of Clare. The removal and addition of sound in and out, to me at least, represented their traveling back and forth to actually be together at xmas, but what must have been a slightly chaotic time. \n\nThe second section, the music stops on cue of one of the family members saying \"it's stopped\". I then wanted some silence whilst there is the surprise entry of Byron, and then the expletive of his sister. I had to remove a part of the recording due to a clip, it was going to be left in, but the \"OMG\" and \"WTF\" didn't seem to both be required to represent her surprise.\n\nFrom here, again being conscious of not removing the soul from this wonderful family moment, I just wanted to do a simple composition, that hopefully captures some sort of happiness being reached now that time has taken it's time somewhat. I felt the subtle pad and chord progression added this emotion well enough. I do hope that if Rob hears it, he feels what I've tried to do.. and I thank their entire family for contributing to the project, and do indeed wish them every bit of well as they move forward in life.",

The first part, Then\", is meant to be a bit discordant and slightly challenging. Fast bpm, strident music in 4/4, various sounds of war: sirens, explosions, missile launches, dogs barking, a crying child and eventually a door slams. The second part, \"Now\", slowly unfolds into a waltz-like signature mixing in the steps of the person gardening. The bass drum and snare sound were cut and repeated from some noise in the field recording. The music in the second part is melodious, featuring intertwining, peaceful, major chord melodies.\n\nI can see the woman spinning and dancing along to the music from \"Now\" with a beatific smile on her face.",

I felt deeply connected to tango 25 years ago and this pull on my heart inspired me to migrate halfway across the globe. \n\nI have been absorbed by tango, the stylish essence mixed with the mugre (filth) of the big city streets, the rhythmic swing that belongs to Buenos Aires, the stickiness of the air & the glisten of the dancers sweat as they dance in leather bottomed shoes, embraced.",

    "city_title": "An afternoon prayer",
    "about_the_recording": "The recording captures a scene where various everyday sounds are heard, including the call to prayer (Adhan) from a nearby mosque, footsteps of a dog in the house, barking dogs outside, chirping birds, and children playing in the background. The people involved could be the imam or muezzin calling for prayer, pedestrians going about their daily activities, stray dogs and children enjoying their time outdoors.\n\nThis recording resonates with the theme of migration by portraying the multicultural and diverse environment often found in urban settings as well as Albania, a place where many people leave from to live abroad. The call to prayer, a quintessential sound in Islamic culture, is a typical sound mark in many places in Albania. As a person coming \"back\" to my parent's hometown, this sound feels very foreign to me, having grown up in Greece, but i remember always finding it fascinating in my childhood, visiting Albania. This relates to the background of Albanians migrating to other countries and some of the cultural effects to the next generations as well as other cultural influences towards Albania. Additionally, the mixture of sounds from various sources reflects the blending of cultures and backgrounds that occurs in areas shaped by migration.\n\nThe sound captures the harmonious coexistence of different elements in a community perceived by a person shaped by migration, having \"come back\" in different forms. The call to prayer serves as a reminder of cultural and religious diversity, while the sounds of footsteps, dogs, birds, and children playing evoke the vitality and liveliness of the neighborhood. Despite language barriers and cultural differences, the everyday sounds create a sense of shared space and interconnectedness among residents.\n\nThe recordist may experience a sense of curiosity, fascination, alienation, childhood memories and appreciation for the rich tapestry of sounds that make up the urban environment. The call to prayer may evoke feelings of respect or intrigue, regardless of the recordist's religious background or understanding of the language. The presence of everyday sounds like footsteps, dogs, birds, and children playing may elicit a sense of comfort, familiarity, and belonging, highlighting the mundane yet reassuring aspects of everyday life in a migrant community.",

    "about_the_reimagined_sound": "I thought about the sample and how musical it is, yet so different from Western musical traditions of tuning and rhythm, and it's also part-spoken, rich in spiritual and cultural heritage. The sample is full of background noise, which can be annoying in music, but I find it gives a sense of place and enhances memories, including my own, of being in Arabic countries. I was interested also in playing with the vocal sounds as pure musical sound, de-contextualised from the rich meaning and intention of the words. \n\nThe whole piece is framed in longer samples where the original sample is clearly articulated. So this is a piece of musique concr\u00e9te, where my sound sources come entirely from the one call-to-prayer sample which I have manipulated electronically, cut, spliced, reversed, filtered, pitch-changed, equalised, resonated, passed through a Moog synthesiser to create an abstract soundscape that evokes new experiences of new places. I arranged these processed sounds to create the sense of a migration journey, through hope, despair, joy, loneliness, anger, fear, friendship, constantly moving forwards. An ethereal walking or marching pulse links different moods and experiences, anchored by contrasting memories of home that are unsettling or reassuring.",

    "about_the_recording": "Morning dawn in Tirana, Albania. The recordist, who has migrated from Tirana to Berlin for studies, returns to visit family. During this visit, they cannot fall asleep because of the sound of a lion roaring nearby. Balcony recording: morning rooster, other background animal sounds possibly dogs, at some point the main reason i cannot sleep: the lion downstairs caged in the zoo.\n\nThe recording relates to migration thematically as it captures the experience of the recordist, who has moved from Greece to Albania and then migrated to Germany to pursue opportunities abroad. The encounter with the tough picture of the caged lion, a creature typically associated with different geographical regions, highlights the displacement and disorientation experienced by migrants in unfamiliar environments. It also wants to bring awareness in more-than-human perspectives of displacement and freedom of movement. \n\nThe sound of the lion roaring in the vicinity of the recordist's home in Tirana serves as a metaphorical and literal wake-up call. It prompts the recordist to contemplate their own sense of belonging and identity in the context of migration. The juxtaposition of the familiar sound of the rooster signaling morning with the unexpected presence of the lion creates a surreal and thought-provoking atmosphere. The lion often called the king of the jungle-is roaring together with the morning-specialist-rooster in the dawn in a city where it does not belong. \n\nThe recordist may experience a mix of emotions, including surprise, nostalgia, anger and introspection. The sudden encounter with the lion symbolizes the complexities and challenges of migration, stirring feelings of displacement and questioning of one's place in the world. The presence of the caged lion also evokes a sense of vulnerability, injustice and interconnectedness with the natural world, prompting reflection on humanity's relationship with nature in the context of migration. Being awake in this time of the day i reflect on the human impact on our surroundings and questioning  the concept of \"home\". Who is the migrant in this story? Is there a winner in the story or a king of the mo(u)rning? ",

    "about_the_reimagined_sound": "I have played with all the elements of the original recording and added 2 clips from recordings of mine in the mix - a spring dawn chorus and clay flutes activated by my voice in an installation. The process and re-mix reminds me of Cumulonimbus clouds which are born through convection, often growing from small cumulus clouds over a hot surface. \n\nThey get taller and taller until they represent huge powerhouses, storing the same amount of energy as 10 Hiroshima-sized atom bombs. They can also form along cold fronts as a result of forced convection, where milder air is forced to rise over the incoming cold air.",
